1. **Potential for Human-AI Relationships Using LLMs**

- The conversation introduced the idea of AI, particularly LLMs, not as a source of truth but as a "tool" that can be used to explore unknown areas of knowledge, referencing the concept of "lygometry" as measuring what we don't know. This suggests that AI can be a partner in the exploration of knowledge, pushing the boundaries of our understanding and aiding in the discovery process.
    
- The conversation highlighted the potential of AI to serve as a cognitive tool, assisting in the organization of thoughts and making connections between disparate pieces of knowledge. This aligns with the potential for AI to enhance learning by providing personalized learning experiences and insights that are beyond the capacity of human cognition alone.
    

### 2. **Types of Relationships Between TCs and AI Tools**

- The use of AI was discussed in augmenting the learning process for teacher candidates, emphasizing the critical and balanced view of technology integration in teaching. The discussion suggested that TCs could develop a symbiotic relationship with AI tools, where AI aids in curriculum understanding, lesson planning, and providing educational content that TCs can then critically evaluate and adapt to their teaching contexts.
    
- The conversation also touched upon the iterative nature of learning with AI, where feedback loops between TCs and AI tools could foster a deeper understanding of subjects and pedagogical strategies, suggesting a collaborative relationship where both human and AI contribute to the educational process.
    

### 3. **Theoretical Frameworks Informing the TC-AI Relationship**

- The discussion implicitly referenced several theoretical frameworks that could inform the TC-AI relationship, including #**constructivism** (learning as an active, constructive process), #**connectivism** (the learning theory for the digital age that emphasizes the role of social and technological networks in learning), and #**activity theory** (which could explain how AI tools mediate learning activities and the development of cognitive processes in educational contexts).
    
- Michael's mention of #**activity theory** explicitly ties into how technology can support learning and teaching contexts, suggesting that this framework could be particularly relevant in understanding the TC-AI relationship. It positions AI as a mediating tool that, within a network of human activities, can transform the learning process, challenge traditional pedagogies, and redefine the goals and outcomes of teacher education programs.
    

### 4. **Challenging and Informing Teacher Education Programs**

- The potential for AI to challenge and inform teacher education programs lies in its capacity to individualize learning, provide access to a vast array of information, and offer new ways of understanding and interacting with content. This requires teacher education programs to reconsider how TCs are prepared, moving towards pedagogies that embrace technology as a partner in the teaching and learning process.
    
- Educator preparation might increasingly need to include critical digital literacy, where TCs are trained not only to use AI tools effectively but also to understand their limitations, ethical considerations, and the importance of human oversight in educational settings.
    

The framework emerging from the conversation suggests that the future of teacher education and the integration of AI tools like LLMs will likely be grounded in theoretical frameworks that emphasize active, connected, and mediated learning. This integration challenges traditional models of education by promoting a partnership between human and AI in the learning process, necessitating a reevaluation of how teacher candidates are prepared, accredited, and supported throughout their professional development.
