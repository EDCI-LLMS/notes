- Q1:

 - AI Co-Creative Partner
- Position: Very close to horizontal, where AI serves not just as a mirror of thought but actively contributes to creative processes.
- Characteristics: AI helps generate ideas, suggests alternatives, and provides feedback, encouraging divergent thinking and creativity. The student refines, evaluates, and integrates these contributions into their work.
- AI Socratic Tutor
- Position: Slightly oblique towards the horizontal, emphasizing guided discovery.
- Characteristics: AI asks probing questions, challenging the student to think deeply and critically about subjects. It offers hints rather than answers, fostering an environment where students are led to insights through inquiry.
- AI Collaborative Analyst
	-Position: Midway on the cline, balancing directive and collaborative elements.
	-Characteristics: In this role, AI assists in analyzing data or texts, offering interpretations that the student must assess, critique, or build upon. This collaborative analysis encourages the student to engage deeply with material, applying their understanding to AI-generated insights.
- AI Personalized Learning Assistant
	-Position: Leaning more towards the vertical, focusing on customization and support.
	-Characteristics: AI personalizes learning materials based on the student's progress, preferences, and performance. It suggests resources, schedules study sessions, and offers practice questions, acting as a supportive, though somewhat directive, guide.
- AI Curated Content Provider
	-Position: Closer to the vertical, with AI primarily delivering content.
	-Characteristics: AI compiles and curates educational content based on the student's courses or interests. The student's role is more receptive, engaging with AI-selected materials, but with less critical or creative input required.
- AI Automated Tutor
	-Position: Near the vertical end, where AI's role is to provide answers and explanations with minimal student input. 
	-Characteristics: AI functions as an on-demand tutor, answering questions and explaining concepts directly. This model risks reduced student engagement and critical thinking, aligning with the "master/student" dynamic.
 - AI "Shifu"- the unquestionable, unquestioned source of truth and problem/assignment solver, whose words are taken with no question or (critical) thought by the student - the least desirable yet 

- Q2
- AI in training/alignment/RHLF**Student Training/Involvement in AI Design**: This unique relationship in Q2 highlights scenarios where TCs contribute to the training, alignment, or design of AI/LLMs. Such involvement not only allows TCs to shape the AI tools that will impact their future teaching practices but also provides them with deeper insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in educational settings.
- **Potential Relationships in Q2**:
    - **Co-Designers of Educational AI Tools**: TCs work alongside AI developers to inform the creation of AI tools that are pedagogically sound and responsive to the needs of diverse learners.
    - **AI as a Reflective Practitioner**: TCs engage with AI in a manner where the AI tool prompts reflection on teaching practices, lesson planning, and student engagement strategies, acting as a catalyst for professional growth.
    - **Research Collaborators**: TCs participate in research projects investigating the impact of AI in education, contributing both their pedagogical expertise and their firsthand experiences with AI in the classroom.
